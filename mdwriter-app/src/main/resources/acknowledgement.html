        <p>We'd like to express our heartfelt gratitude to everyone who has encouraged us to work on this project. First
            and foremost, we'd like to express our gratitude to the entire team of %s for this chance, especially the
            professors of science and technology, who assisted us in furthering our knowledge in this field.</p>
        <br>
        <p>And we'd like to express our special gratitude to our supervisor, <span class="bold">Mr. %s</span>, who has
            consistently encouraged, inspired and provided us with a wealth of information that has been beneficial. His
            advice was helpful in completing this assignment. We could not have asked for a better supervisor,
            counselor, or mentor.</p>
        <br>
        <p>This project would not have been possible without the assistance of each member, as well as the entire class,
            who offered suggestions, shared their experiences, and provided advice throughout the project. We are
            grateful for this. Finally, we'd like to express our gratitude to our friends and colleagues who supported
            us directly and indirectly throughout this project.</p>
